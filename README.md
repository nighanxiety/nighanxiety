- 👋 Hi, I’m @nighanxiety
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in general, and I like helping other learners. I'm more confident about backend than frontend as I doubt my graphic design abilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Python and working Harvard's CS50x Course
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...  not sure yet.... Maybe CSX50 Puzzle Day?
- 📫 How to reach me ... Discord user RisingZan #5079  
(I'm likely to change my Discord name to match my github name at some point in the near future. I'm trying to consolidate all my social media names.)
